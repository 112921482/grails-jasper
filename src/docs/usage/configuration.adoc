=== Configuration

The default location for your report templates is `/src/main/webapp/reports` in your project directory. Here you can place your *.jasper or *.jrxml (jrxml files will be compiled automatically by the plugin).

[[INFO]]
====
Work with `jrxml` files if you can! They can be compiled by the plugin if a newer jasperreport version is available. This way you don't need to manually recompile all your reports if you want to use the new version with braking changes.
====

You can set another report folder location with the jasper.dir.reports property in your `application.yml`.

[source, yaml]

It's possible to use different locations for different environments.
